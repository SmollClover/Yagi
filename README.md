## An Anti-Raid Bot for Discord Servers with simplistic logic

---

This Bot is designed to be really simple. So simple infact, that it should be a good starting point to get an idea on how to detect a Raid on a Discord Server.

The Logic is not designed to be really indepth with checking a Users messages and the frequenzy of how often he messages, instead it focuses on how many Users join in a given timespan.

### Setup

-   Create a file called `.env` and add your Bot Token to it
    -   TOKEN=SampleToken
-   Invite the Bot to your Discord Server
-   Start with `node main.js`
